									Can an industrial robot arm be taught to express its artistic side? For a class project, two friends and I developed a image-processing
									and control system for the KUKA-IIWA, allowing it to sketch just about any image. From portraits to complex symbols, like the Stanford logo (pictured above)
									we achieved a high degree of image-likeness.
									<br/> <br/>
                  Our project code can be found <a href="https://github.com/pquiggles/robotic_sketching">on Github</a>.

									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7gZzhs6JMk">Convex optimization</a> is like linear programming on steroids. It is a powerful tool used by researcher in fields including engineering and economics.
									Two friends and I wrote CVXCanon, a C++/Python library to <em>canonicalize</em> convex optimization problems so that they can solved efficiently by existing software.
									<br/><br/>
									CVXCanon has been incorporated into IEEE Fellow Stephen Boyd's CVX project, and is widely used today.

									Four friends and I built our vision of the future of the quantified self movement. Like a fitbit, but measuring complex biomedical metrics such as pulse arrival time. We built this from Arduino, and good ol' raw analog components.
									<br/><br/>
									We began this project in Stanford's Internet of Things Hackathon, where we won <b>first place out of more than twenty teams.</b></p>

                <p>How does the brain translate motor commands (e.g. move my hand to the left) into neural signals? I worked with profsseor Oussama Khatib and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~smenon/">Samir Menon</a> in the Stanford Robotics Lab
									to explore this complex question. I worked on a data-analsysis pipeline that used statistical classification, and assisted with experimental design.

									I worked with a team of Stanford CS students sponsored by SAP to develop software to improve operations in warehouses. This started as an open-ended project, and after interviewing dozens of warehouse operators, we wrote software to help them optimize the placement
									of items in their warehouse to improve the throughput and efficiency of their distribution centers.

									We won multiple sponsored awards for best project at <a href="http://cs210.github.io/fair-guide/">Stanford's Software Fair.</a></p>

                <p>What makes a $200 Bose headphone set sound so much better than cheapo headphones like the ones they give you on airlines? A big part of that is unbalanced levels in the cheap headphone's frequency response. My partner in crime Jack Zhu and I built an analog/digital system that would detect imbalances in a headphone's frequency response and attempt to correct them.
									<br/><br/>
									We published an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Automatic-Headphone-Equalizer/">online Instructable</a> if you want to see some of the work that was involved in implementation.
